<p>About Bloc</p>

<p>Bloc is the world’s largest online coding bootcamp that incorporates 1 on 1 mentorship to personally prepare each student as a professional software engineer. Bloc's apprenticeship approach is tailored specifically to students' learning needs. Enroll full-time, or complete your program at a part-time pace. Not everyone can quit their career or move, so Bloc has designed a comprehensive bootcamp with this in mind. With Bloc, a dedicated mentor will provide 1 on 1 instruction to clarify concepts and pair program with each student. Bloc’s project-based curriculum is written by expert Curriculum Developers. Students work with mentors to build a portfolio of sites that will demonstrate job readiness as a professional software engineer.</p>

<p>Career readiness is important - Bloc's flagship Track programs include job preparation material and access to a Placement Network when you’re ready. Mentors will help students put together a portfolio and prepare technical interview questions. When ready, students work with the Career Support team to navigate the job search process with an individualized game plan and exposure to Bloc's Employer Network.</p>

<p>No prior development experience is required to enroll in Bloc, but a strong desire to learn and take on challenges will be important in each student's success!</p>

<p>My experience with Bloc</p>

<p>I'm a current Bloc student as well, and below is the feedback I have about learning to code with them and learning to code in general (in summary, it is and has been going very well).</p>

<p>The best part of learning to code with Bloc has been the dynamic between the challenging projects and the mentor meetings. The projects by themselves taught me a ton, and then the meetings with my mentor reinforce what I’ve learned from the projects, resolve any questions or misconceptions I have, and leave me feeling motivated to learn more. As for learning to code in general, the best part is the tremendous satisfaction I get after solving a difficult problem. That satisfaction, though brief, is highly addictive and makes all the effort worthwhile - and it’s great preparation for even bigger challenges. </p>

<p>The worst part of learning to code, both with Bloc and in general, is the occasional but necessary period of intense struggle. It can be discouraging, but I get through it by remembering this: every rewarding pursuit has rough patches, so they’re bound to show up; and they usually mean that some serious growth is about to happen!</p>

<p>A mentor session usually starts with me giving a progress summary, which also includes any questions I have. Then Matt, my mentor, answers my questions, pair-programs with me when necessary, and lays out the next steps for me to complete for our next session. We also talk about best practices, new developments, and ongoing debates in the web-development world. Of course, each session is also motivating and fun; having a pro to work with goes a long way.</p>

<p>Bloc is tough, but it's worth it: the mentors and the projects will push you so that you get the most out of the program.</p>
