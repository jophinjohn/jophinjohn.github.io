  <section class="post-content"><p>Challenges as a programmer:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Those annoying "hey I can't open. It crashes" kind of bug reports. Well how are programmers suppose to solve/debug when no info is given along with bug reports!!</p></li>
<li><p>The documentation of applications are seldom read by others. The users tend to ignore them and keep PMing the coder for easy info. You spend hours documenting the application and no one cares  about it!</p></li>
<li><p>Programmer is frustrated the more often than not when he/she gets an output for the first time he/she compiles a group of codes. Might even think of editing the code to get at-least one error! </p></li>
<li><p>The biggest challenge comes in optimizing the code, to reduce the loading time. Undoubtedly, if you're not well - acquainted with any language, then writing the program in itself would be the biggest challenge!</p></li>
<li><p>He/she also faces a lot of problems and challenges while deploying the changes made (code enhancements) according to the needs of end-user. Most of the times, programmers get enhancements on a daily basis. Faced it while deploying my Ruby code from testing stage to the production  stage.</p></li>
<li><p>I often found it hard to ask a question. The issue was not with Bloc The problem being with me as a programmer should solve all problems myself approach. This would involve endless hours of finding simplest solution to a problem. Problems which could be solved in a few minutes by an expert.  Raising a hand to ask questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Talking about questions. Programmers tend to ask questions very vaguely . And context of a problem is important too. Understanding the context brings about clarity and approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Communication: Finding out what is needed via communication and finding out the best possible approach to solve an issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Keeping up with technology. New versions of software. Compatibility issues and the learning curve. Time is a big factor and money.  For example : I just finished learning Angular JS , and I have found out that Angular 2 is just released which is albeit a bit more complex but with better framework it is preloaded with more goodies which can save time.</p></li>
<li><p>An application will eventually break; Bad deploy, unintended behaviour, unintended input or unintended external load. Plan for that. This includes making sure you log uncaught exceptions, test a deploy works after it's out (and potentially roll back), should run tests continously.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep your version control system's branches short-lived. My experience is that risk of failures increases exponentially the longer a branch lives. Avoid working on a branch for more than two weeks. For large features, break them into multiple refactoring branches to make the feature easier to implement in a few commits.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing comments will be a challenge. Finding an aha moment and writing the corresponding comment in real time will be very crucial. Helps for a better read by others and yourself. Also , as I figured out the comments lead to an internal version control system for me and allowed me to review my code better for finding potential errors.</p></li>
